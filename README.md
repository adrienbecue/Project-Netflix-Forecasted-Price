5. Fundamental Analysis

5.1 Revenue and Profitability Growth
Netflix’s total revenue surged to $39.3 billion in 2024,
marking a 16% year-over-year increase. In the fourth
quarter alone, Netflix reported $10.2 billion in
revenue and a net profit of $2.23 billion, reflecting a
remarkable 27% increase from the same quarter in
the previous year. This consistent growth highlights
the company’s ability to scale its business model
efficiently while maintaining strong profitability.

5.2 ARPU Growth and Stock Price Reaction
Netflix’s average revenue per user (ARPU) saw a 5.2%
uptick, driven by strategic price adjustments and the
expanding adoption of its ad-supported subscription
tier. The strong financial performance led to a
significant 11.7% jump in Netflix’s stock price,
reaching $972.03 following the announcement of
these robust earnings.

6. Content Strategy as a Catalyst for Growth

6.1 The Power of Blockbuster Content
A key element in this upward trajectory is Netflix’s
ability to consistently produce and acquire
compelling content, which has proven crucial in
attracting and retaining subscribers. High-profile
releases, such as "Squid Game" Season 2 and
"Stranger Things" Season 5 in late 2024, fueled a
sharp increase in subscriber growth, with 18.9
million new users added during the holiday quarter
alone.

6.2 Historical Correlation Between Content and
Stock Price
This content-driven growth not only bolsters
Netflix’s revenue but also positively influences
investor sentiment, as seen in the 11.7% surge in its
share price following these major releases. Historical
patterns support this correlation; for instance,
Netflix’s stock increased by 23% in the six months
after "Squid Game" Season 1 debuted in 2021. Given
the upcoming pipeline of major releases, a similar
positive market response is anticipated, further
solidifying content’s central role in Netflix’s stock
evolution.
