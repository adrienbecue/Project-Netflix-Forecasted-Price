Fundamental Analysis

Revenue and Profitability Growth
Netflix’s total revenue surged to $39.3 billion in 2024,
marking a 16% year-over-year increase. In the fourth
quarter alone, Netflix reported $10.2 billion in
revenue and a net profit of $2.23 billion, reflecting a
remarkable 27% increase from the same quarter in
the previous year. This consistent growth highlights
the company’s ability to scale its business model
efficiently while maintaining strong profitability.

ARPU Growth and Stock Price Reaction
Netflix’s average revenue per user (ARPU) saw a 5.2%
uptick, driven by strategic price adjustments and the
expanding adoption of its ad-supported subscription
tier. The strong financial performance led to a
significant 11.7% jump in Netflix’s stock price,
reaching $972.03 following the announcement of
these robust earnings.

Content Strategy as a Catalyst for Growth

The Power of Blockbuster Content
A key element in this upward trajectory is Netflix’s
ability to consistently produce and acquire
compelling content, which has proven crucial in
attracting and retaining subscribers. High-profile
releases, such as "Squid Game" Season 2 and
"Stranger Things" Season 5 in late 2024, fueled a
sharp increase in subscriber growth, with 18.9
million new users added during the holiday quarter
alone.

Historical Correlation Between Content and
Stock Price

This content-driven growth not only bolsters
Netflix’s revenue but also positively influences
investor sentiment, as seen in the 11.7% surge in its
share price following these major releases. Historical
patterns support this correlation; for instance,
Netflix’s stock increased by 23% in the six months
after "Squid Game" Season 1 debuted in 2021. Given
the upcoming pipeline of major releases, a similar
positive market response is anticipated, further
solidifying content’s central role in Netflix’s stock
evolution.

Strategic Expansions: Live Sports and New
Market Penetration

Entry into the Live Sports Market

Netflix’s push into live sports streaming, including
the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, marks a strategic
shift.

Sports Partnerships and Subscriber Growth

Netflix’s ongoing negotiations with the NFL and its
expanded Formula 1 coverage aim to capture the
lucrative sports market, potentially drawing millions
of new subscribers. If executed successfully, these
initiatives could bring up 40 million additional
subscribers by 2027, reinforcing Netflix’s long-term
growth trajectory.

Expansion into the Gaming Industry
Additionally, Netflix’s entry into the gaming market,
with projections to generate over $1 billion in
additional revenue by 2026, represents another
strategic pivot towards capturing a wider
entertainment spectrum.

Macroeconomic Factors Driving Netflix’s
Growth

Favorable U.S. Economic Environment
The U.S. economy exhibited resilience, with a 3.1%
GDP growth rate in the third quarter of 2024,
followed by 2.3% in the fourth quarter. This steady
economic expansion fosters a positive environment
for discretionary spending, including entertainment
services like Netflix.

Corporate Tax Policies Enhancing Profitability

Corporate tax policies further support Netflix’s
growth. The reduction of the corporate tax rate from
35% to 21% under the Trump administration remains
a major advantage for Netflix and other U.S.
corporations, significantly boosting after-tax
profitability. While discussions around a 15% global
minimum corporate tax rate continue in the U.S.

Consumer Spending Trends Supporting Subscription-Based Models

A 4.5% increase in household disposable income in
2024 has strengthened consumer spending capacity,
which directly benefits subscription-based services
like Netflix. Unlike traditional advertising-driven
media, Netflix’s subscription model offers stable
revenue streams that are less impacted by short-term
economic fluctuations, making it an attractive
investment during economic uncertainty
